# Intelligent Resource Allocation in LoRaWAN Networks

## Introduction
This code is a modified version of IoT-MAB which is a discrete-event simulator based on SimPy for simulating intelligent distributed resource allocation in LoRa networks and to analyse scalability. The classed and functions for Physical layer of LoRA has also been combined. 

## Modifications
The code has been modified to model more realistic wireless channel model along with incoporation of EXP4 algorithm for SF allocation and supervised ML for transmission power allocation.
